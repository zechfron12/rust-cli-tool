#Goals

    1.echo: repeats input
    2.cat: concatenates files
    3.ls: lists directories
    4.find: locates files or directories
    5.grep: matches text in files

- Add extra flags to the tools to enhance their feature set
- Use proper error handling so the programs don't end prematurely (no .unwrap() and no .expect())
- Add multi-threading support. find and grep are good candidates for this
- Add colorized output
